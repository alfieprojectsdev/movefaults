# Project Roadmap: Phased Implementation Based on Dependency Hierarchies

**Last updated:** 2026-03-03
**Original date:** 2026-01-26

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the roadmap for the Philippine Open Geodesy Framework (POGF) monorepo,
structured around a phased implementation based on technical dependencies. Foundational components
are built before dependent systems to minimise rework.

---

## 2. Domain Terminology: The Nuance of "Campaign"

A key term requiring clarification is "campaign," which has distinct meanings within the project:

- **Campaign GPS (Observation Method):** Periodic, temporary GNSS deployments for measuring
  slow interseismic motion (hours to days in the field).
- **Continuous GPS (cGPS) (Observation Method):** Permanently installed GNSS receivers.
  - *Proprietary raw data:* High-rate observations for Bernese post-processing.
  - *VADASE real-time data:* NMEA streams for rapid displacement detection (`vadase-rt-monitor`).
- **Bernese Processing Campaign (Software Context):** A Bernese GNSS Software execution run
  on a defined set of observation data over a time window. Distinct from field "campaign GPS."

**Goal:** Automate the workflow for *both* observation methods, organising them into efficient
Bernese processing campaigns.

---

## 3. Overall Project Goal

Establish the POGF by consolidating disparate codebases and manual workflows into a single,
unified, maintainable monorepo — a cohesive system for ingesting, processing, analysing, and
distributing geodetic data from PHIVOLCS' GNSS network.

### Tier 3: Core Data Processing

> Primary scientific processing engine. Depends on robust data ingestion from Tier 2.

**Deliverable 1.3: Automated Bernese Processing Workflow** 🔬 **RESEARCH COMPLETE — IMPLEMENTATION STARTING**

Research milestones completed (2026-02-26/27):
- Bernese 5.4 **installed and verified** on T420 — EXAMPLE campaign BPE ran 47 steps, solutions
  match reference at ≤0.09 mm
- Non-interactive BPE API confirmed: `startBPE.pm` Perl module (`$BPE/startBPE.pm`)
- Full BPE phase map documented (47 steps, quality gates, output files)
- PHIVOLCS-specific INP settings extracted from work instruction via RAG (GPSEST ×3,
  HELMR1, MAUPRP, ADDNEQ2, CODSPP)
- Post-BPE velocity pipeline fully mapped (`filter-fncrd.bat` → `plot_v2.py` →
  `vel_line_v8.m` → outlier review → final velocity)
- Bernese orchestration explainer written for data processing staff
- **velocity-reviewer tool** built and complete: web-based replacement for the Windows-only
  `outlier_input-site.py` GUI; PLOT file stripping on export via `write_cleaned_plots()`
  (location: `tools/velocity-reviewer/`, commit `bd743bb`)

Research milestones completed (2026-03-03):
- **INP file diff complete** (PHIVOLCS 5.2 vs EXAMPLE 5.4): ADDNEQ2, MAUPRP, RNXGRA,
  RXOBV3, CODSPP — only 3 parameters need Jinja2 overrides (RNXGRA MINOBS/MAXBAD,
  ADDNEQ2 MAXPAR); all path variables injected by PCF at runtime
- **Primary source code verification**: PLOT file format confirmed from `RUNX_v2.py:137`;
  offsets format confirmed from production `analysis/offsets` file; `vel_line_v8.m`
  confirmed does NOT read `OUTLIERS.txt` (has internal `rmoutliers(ThresholdFactor=3)`);
  `00_CRD_*.bat` three-variant exclusion logic mapped; teqc commands confirmed from §4.2.3
- **`offset_events` DB table** complete (Migration 007) — materialises to offsets flat file
  before MATLAB run; decimal year computed at materialisation time
- **8 campaign file generation order** confirmed: STA → CRD+ABB → ATL → PLD → VEL → CLU → BLQ;
  BLQ from Chalmers web service (FES2004 model, no tabs, 24-char fixed-column)

Pending:
- R740 Bernese installation (same procedure as T420, no ISA mismatch)
- Jinja2 INP templates from completed diff → `LinuxBPEBackend` skeleton
- `plot_v2.py` parameterisation (interactive reference station prompt → CLI arg)

Architecture decisions:
- `BPEBackend` protocol: `LinuxBPEBackend` (R740) + `WindowsBPEBackend` (future)
- Two pipeline variants: Campaign GPS (single-pass BPE) vs. Continuous GPS (two-pass BPE)
- Pre-download IGS products via our downloader (skip/bypass BPE step 000 FTP_DWLD)
- Human-in-the-loop gate at outlier review; all other steps automated

- *Spec: `docs/project_documentation/pogf_infrastructure/tech_spec_bernese_workflow.md`*

---

### Tier 4: Analysis, Presentation & Automation

> Consume, analyse, and present processed data.

**Deliverable 2.4: Geodetic Post-Processing & Modeling Suite** 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**
- Port legacy MATLAB/Python scripts from `analysis/` into `packages/pogf-geodetic-suite/`
- Covers: time series analysis, dislocation modeling, bootstrapping, visualization
- **`velocity-reviewer` tool complete** (`tools/velocity-reviewer/`, commit `bd743bb`):
  browser-based ENU time series review, IQR auto-outlier detection, PLOT file stripping
  on export with backup/restore for idempotency — replaces Windows-only GUI
- Remaining: port `RUNX_v2.py` → Python library; port `vel_line_v8.m` → Python; dislocation models
- *Spec: `docs/project_documentation/gnss_automation_modules/tech_spec_timeseries_suite.md`*

**Deliverable 1.4: Public Data Portal and API** ⏳ **PENDING**
- React/FastAPI web application; open access to processed historical geodetic data
- Cross-links to `vadase-rt-monitor` for real-time views
- *Spec: `docs/project_documentation/pogf_infrastructure/tech_spec_portal_api.md`*

**Deliverable 3.2: Automated Processing Documentation** ⏳ **PENDING**
- Auto-generate CLI help, config references from source; integrate into MkDocs build
- *Spec: `docs/project_documentation/documentation_portal/tech_spec_autodocs.md`*

---

## 6. VADASE Real-Time Monitor

`services/vadase-rt-monitor/` (~80% complete) is developed on a parallel track independent
of the Bernese pipeline. Key remaining work:

- Fix one-way latch bug in `domain/processor.py:130` (`manual_integration_active` never resets)
- `TCPAdapter`: implement NTRIP client handshake for Leica GR50
- Add Trimble sentence parser stubs (currently dead code — GR50 is Leica, not Trimble)
- PR #1 remediation (paused, lower priority than Phase 1B)

---

## 7. Key Principles

- **Iterative development:** Modules within a tier can be developed in parallel once their dependencies are met.
- **Test-driven:** Critical for porting legacy scientific code — correctness must be verified.
- **Open source first:** Avoid vendor lock-in; foster future collaboration.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Orchestration automates mechanics; scientific judgment stays with staff.
- **Documentation-as-code:** Every architectural decision recorded in ADRs; every session logged.
