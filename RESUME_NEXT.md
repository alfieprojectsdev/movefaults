# RESUME — next session

**Updated 2026-07-04. Previous queue (DA-005a) DONE — see tally below.**

## Completed 2026-07-04
- **DA-005a** TUI phase 1 (drive picker + survey) — PR #48 merged.
- **DOSTB GNSS evacuation COMPLETE** — 14,269 files verified on Backup Plus
  `RECOVERED_DOSTB20150918/`: 14,080 from $RECYCLE.BIN ($I/$R pairing) + 86 live
  (`_LIVE/`) + 103 campaign companions (`_COMPANIONS/`). Checksum-verified (rsync -c).
  Bulk = 2021 June North Luzon cGPS (IESAS). Archive triage: no field GNSS in the
  3,831 archives (all IGS/EU-station test data). Manifests/scripts:
  `~/surveys/DOSTB20150918/`. SSD staging deleted. DOSTB bin-empty = Alfie manual.
- **DA-006** `drive-arch recover pair|copy` — PR #49 merged (incl. CR fixes:
  `..` traversal → `_orphaned/`, errors persisted to `<output>.errors.txt`).
- **Drive policy set:** 1TB Backup Plus = project property, official GNSS home;
  2TB DOSTB = personal, GNSS evacuated.

## NEXT TASK (recommended): DA-005b — scan screen, DESIGN PAGE FIRST
One-page design to append to `tools/drive-archaeologist/docs/TUI_PLAN.md` before code:
- **Process model decision:** Alfie confirmed multi-hour scans inevitable (5TB NAS,
  old 3.5" HDDs) → target = detached subprocess (TUI spawns `drive-arch scan` CLI,
  state file with PID+output+drive identity, progress via jsonl tail, reattach on
  reopen). NOT thread-worker (dies with app — 005a's known gotcha).
- **Checkpoint scaling:** current CheckpointManager rewrites full scanned-paths JSON
  every 1000 files — quadratic I/O at 5M files. Needs append-only log or SQLite
  BEFORE any NAS scan.
- Rest is mechanical: path picker, clobber dialog (scanner already raises
  FileExistsError), progress bar + ETA from survey count via on_progress seam.

## Also open
- **Classifier tickets:** $I/$R prefix awareness (5,500 stubs counted as GNSS on
  DOSTB, +28% inflation); `.iNN` ancillary pattern (APAR132m.i46 missed); archive
  entry-listing triage mode (list zip/gz contents without extraction).
- **Backup Plus migration EXEC** (Phase 3): manifest ready
  `~/surveys/BackupPlus/migration_manifest_v2.tsv` (96k files, 133.7 GiB). Still
  blocked: ≥140 GiB target disk + 30S_01H-vs-30S_1H decision. Note: recovered
  DOSTB data now also on this drive awaiting canonical DATAPOOL placement.
- ING-005 gfzrnx QC backend (license-gated); BRN-001 R740 Bernese install.
- Worktrees `.trees/da-005a-tui`, `.trees/da-006-recovery` — merged, prunable.

## Workflow reminders (see memory)
- Worktree per feature; `uv sync --extra dev --extra drive-archaeologist
  [--extra drive-archaeologist-tui]` inside; `git checkout -- uv.lock` unless deps changed.
- Tests via `uv run --no-sync`. PRs via `bash scripts/open_pr.sh`; merge via
  `bash scripts/merge_pr.sh <n>`; verify origin/main advanced (retry on
  "base branch was modified" race). NO Claude/AI refs in commits.

## State snapshot
- main = `9d0214f` (PR #48 TUI + PR #49 recover merged).
- Backup Plus (1TB, project): mounted rw, holds RECOVERED_DOSTB20150918 (9 GB).
- DOSTB (2TB, personal): GNSS evacuated; bins await Alfie's manual empty.
- /home freed to ~7.7G (lean_machine run 2026-07-04; docker prune line is a hazard
  when TimescaleDB is up — volumes of stopped containers get wiped).
